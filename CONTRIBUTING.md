# Contributing to Boostimer
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Boostimer Uses [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Make that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v3.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL v3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/xaviranik/boostimer/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/xaviranik/boostimer/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example]()

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
